# C++ Data Structures and Algorithms Implementations

A personal C++ library featuring implementations of common data structures and algorithms.

Features efficient implementations of:
- Forward Linked List
- Binary Search Tree
- Graphs (directed and undirected)
- Trie
- Segment Tree
- Union-Find
- Fenwick Tree

Algorithms:
- Edmonds-Karp Max Flow algorithm
- Topological Sort

## Motivation

I created this project to improve my understanding of data structures and get practice writing performant C++. Although most implementation have been tested, there is no guarantee that they work.

## Future Work

- Add advanced data structures
- Implement components of the modern C++ library such as smart pointers
- Add more algorithms
